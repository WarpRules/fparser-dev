<h1>Version history</h1>

<p>What's new in v3.1.4
<ul>
 <li>Added new optimizer rules (among others, one which groups common factors
     of subexpressions, ie. it optimizes functions of the form
     <code>"a*b+a*c"</code> into <code>"a*(b+c)"</code>, where <code>a</code>,
     <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are any expressions).
 <li>Added support for compiling without evaluation checks (because it's
     impossible to catch all possible error situations in the first place).
     See the documentation for more info.
 <li>Dropped the plain text documentation file in favor of the html file.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.1.3
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug in the optimizer which manifested itself at least in gcc 4.4
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.1.2
<ul>
 <li>Fixed the bugs in the new optimizer code, and thus the new optimizer
     has been restored.
 <li>Small bugfixes and fine-tuning to make the library more compatible with
     other compilers (especially MSVC++).
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.1.1
<ul>
 <li>Due to several bugs in the new optimizer, the old optimizer (from the
    library version 3.0.3) has been temporarily restored until these bugs
    are fixed. The other new library features are not affected.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.1
<ul>
 <li>The optimizer has been completely rewritten. The new optimizer contains
     more and better optimization rules than before, and is more easily
     extensible.
 <li>The <code>Parse()</code> function now precalculates simple constant
     expressions which can be calculated without compromising parsing speed.
     For example the input function "<code>x+7/2</code>" will be byte-compiled
     into the equivalent of "<code>x+3.5</code>". (Note that precalculation of
     constant expressions at parse time is limited and doesn't work in all
     possible situations. For example a function like "<code>x+1+2</code>"
     cannot be precalculated into "<code>x+3</code>" because of the way
     single-token lookahead recursive descent parsing works. The
     <code>Optimize()</code> function will do a much more comprehensive
     optimization work.)
 <li>A new development version of the library is available. The development
     version of the library contains the full optimizer sources, an extensive
     regression testbed, a Makefile and other tools.
 <li>Fixed bug: The size of the internal stack was incorrectly calculated
     in certain situations where a user-defined function taking 0 parameters
     was used. In some rare circumstances this could potentially cause an
     out-of-boundaries array access.
 <li>A new HTML version of the documentation is available. Also a small
     clarification about authorship and crediting was made to the usage
     license.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.0.3
<ul>
 <li>Fixed bug that caused functions like "<code>-if(x, 1, 2)</code>" to be
     parsed incorrectly. (This bug is a very old one, and caused by the change
     related to the unary minus in the version 2.7 of the library.)
 <li>Changed version numbering to a more logical format.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.0.2
<ul>
 <li>Added support for specifying a delimiter character. (See fparser.txt
     for more details.)
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.0.1
<ul>
 <li>Improved UTF8 support, and minor tweaking and fixes.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.0
<ul>
 <li>Rewrote the parser from scratch. It uses the same parsing technique as
    the old parser (iow. it's a recursive descent parser), but because of
    simplification, refactoring and optimizations the new <code>Parse()</code>
    function is over 5 times faster than the old one for most inputs.
 <li>Support for UTF8-encoded unicode characters in user-defined variable,
    constant, unit and function names.
 <li>Unit names are no longer in a distinct namespace from all the other
    names. Thus now unit names must also be distinct from everything else.
 <li>Added the <code>pow()</code> function (which takes two parameters) to the
    function syntax. Its behavior is identical to that of the <code>^</code>
    operator.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.84
<ul>
 <li>Changed all precompiler constant names to have the <code>FP_</code> prefix, to make
    them more consistent and lessen the danger of name collisions. (This
    breaks backwards compatibility.) Also added support for all the compiling
    options to be configurable without having to modify the fpconfig.hh file.
    Consult the documentation about conditional compiling below.
 <li>Made <code>FP_DISABLE_EVAL</code> to be defined by default (previously it was undefined
    by default). The "<code>eval()</code>" function is way too dangerous and rarely useful,
    so it's better for it to be disabled by default.
 <li>If another function parser was given to a parser with <code>AddFunction()</code>, and
    during evaluation that other parser produced an eval error, the calling
    parser would ignore it. Now the calling parser will return the same eval
    error (and 0 as the return value of the function).
 <li>Fixed a bug in the optimizer which caused things like
    <code>"max(0, min(-2,0))"</code>
    to be wrongly optimized (the return value was wrong).
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.83
<ul>
 <li>Fixed bug in the optimizer which caused functions like
     <code>"x-y*1"</code> to crash.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.82
<ul>
 <li>Fixed bug in the optimizer which caused a crash with some functions.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.81
<ul>
 <li>Added support for units (see help on the <code>AddUnit()</code> method).
 <li>Added support for optionally making the <code>Eval()</code> function
     thread-safe with a precompiler constant.
 <li>Fixed optimizer bug that caused things like "<code>acos(0)</code>" to
     misbehave.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.8
<ul>
 <li>Put the compile-time options to a separate file <code>fpconfig.hh</code>.
 <li>Added comparison operators "<code>!=</code>", "<code>&lt;=</code>" and
     "<code>&gt;=</code>".
 <li>Added an epsilon value to the comparison operators (its value can be
     changed in <code>fpconfig.hh</code> or it can be completely disabled
     there).
 <li>Added unary not operator "<code>!</code>".
 <li>Now user-defined functions can take 0 parameters.
 <li>Added a maximum recursion level to the "<code>eval()</code>" function
    (definable in <code>fpconfig.hh</code>). Now "<code>eval()</code>"
    should never cause an infinite recursion.
    (Note however, that it may still be relevant to disable it completely
    because it is possible to write functions which take enormous amounts
    of time to evaluate even when the maximum recursion level is not reached.)
 <li>Separated the optimizer code to its own file (makes developement easier).
</ul>


<p>What's new in v2.71
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a couple of syntax errors which slipped through in the v2.7
    distribution version:
    <ul>
     <li>non-standard semicolons at the end of namespace blocks
     <li>a compilation error which happens if SUPPORT_OPTIMIZER is disabled
    </ul>
 <li>Included a simple example program.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.7
<ul>
 <li>Changed precedence rules for unary minus and the power operator (<code>^</code>) to
    make it closer in functionality to the power "operator" in mathematics
    (ie. superscript):
    <ul>
     <li> Consecutive power operators at the same precedence level are
      evaluated from right to left. That is, for example <code>"2^3^4"</code> is
      now evaluated as if it had been written as <code>"2^(3^4)"</code> (and not
      as <code>"(2^3)^4"</code> like in previous versions).
     <li> The unary minus in the base of the power has now a lower precedence
      than the power operator. That is, <code>"-2^3"</code> will be evaluated as if
      written as <code>"-(2^3)"</code>, ie. the result is <code>"-8"</code> (and not <code>"8"</code> like in
      previous versions). The unary minus in the exponent is still
      evaluated first because of the right-left precedence change above
      (that is, <code>"-2^-3"</code> is evaluated as <code>"-(2^(-3))"</code>).
    </ul>
 <li> Fixed a bug in the copy-on-write engine.
</ul>


<p>What's new in v2.63
<ul>
 <li>Some tiny fixes to make the library more compatible with BCB4.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.62
<ul>
 <li>Only an addition to the usage license. (Please read it.)
</ul>


<p>What's new in v2.61
<ul>
 <li>Tiny bug fix: Tabs and carriage returns now allowed in the function
     string.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.6
<ul>
 <li>Added a new method: <code>GetParseErrorType()</code>. This method can be used to
    get the type of parsing error (which can be used eg. for customized
    error messages in another language).
 <li>Added working copy constructor and assignment operator (using the
    copy-on-write technique for efficiency). See the "Usage" section for
    details.
 <li>Fixed a problem with the comma operator (<code>,</code>): Comma is not allowed
    anymore anywhere else than separating function parameters. In other
    words, comma is not an operator anymore (just a parameter separator).
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.51:
<ul>
 <li>Tiny fixes to make it work with gcc 2.x (which is still sadly common).
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.5:
<ul>
 <li>A new <code>AddConstant()</code> method for adding constants to the parser.
 <li>Two <code>AddFunction()</code> methods for adding user-defined functions to the parser.
 <li>The library can now handle trigonometrical angles either in radians
    (default) or degrees with an optional parameter of <code>Parse()</code>.
 <li>New functions added: <code>cot()</code>, <code>csc()</code> and <code>sec()</code>.
 <li>Enhancements and bug fixes to the <code>Optimize()</code> method (please consider
    it still as experimental).
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.4:
<ul>
 <li>A new <code>Optimize()</code> method which tries to simplify the bytecode so that
     it will be evaluated faster. Please note that this is still experimental.
 <li>New functions added: <code>atan2()</code> and <code>log10()</code>.
 <li>Two new more detailed syntax error messages (previously simply
     "Syntax error").
</ul>


<p>What's new in v2.3:
<ul>
 <li>Variable names can now have digits and underscores (but they can't begin
     with a digit).
 <li>Parsing speed optimizations. The <code>Parse()</code> method can be even 40% faster
     than in the previous version.
     (Please be aware that the new parser has not been thoroughly tested;
      bugs are possible.)
 <li>A new "semi-undocumented" debugging function for printing the bytecode
     of the current function (in an asm-like syntax). Mostly useless from
     the user's point of view.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.22:
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a tiny bug which made the class to misbehave when an error
     occurred during parsing.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.21:
<ul>
 <li>A tiny fix to make the library work with Borland C++ Builder 4.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v2.2:
<ul>
 <li>Support for long variable names (NOTE: Unfortunately this breaks backwards
     compatibility.)
 <li>New functions: <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, <code>if()</code>, <code>eval()</code>.
 <li>Support for recursive calls (with <code>if()</code> and <code>eval()</code>).
 <li>New operators (mainly for use with if(), but can be used anywhere):
     '<code>=</code>', '<code>&lt;</code>', '<code>&gt;</code>', '<code>&amp;</code>' and '<code>|</code>'.
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>What's new in v2.1:
<ul>
 <li>Parsing speed optimization.

  <p>I implemented the parser from the scratch using a known parsing algorithm
  from classical compiler techniques, thus replacing my old ad&nbsp;hoc parser.
  <p>The parser should be much faster now, specially with long functions with
  lots of parentheses (specially when the expressions inside parentheses are
  very long).
  <p>I made a test with the function
  "<code>((2*(5+x*(cos(y-x)/3+2)/4)+1)/4+x)-1</code>" in
  a Sun Ultra 5 computer. The version 2.0 of the library parses it in
  approximately 0.21 ms, while the new version 2.1 parses it in 0.115 ms.
  (I performed the test by parsing the function 100000 times and then dividing
  the total time by that.)
  <p>Needs lots of testing to make sure that it works!
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>What's new in v2.0:
<ul>
 <li> Slight changes in the interface.<br>
    I'm sorry for the lost backwards compatibility, but the v1.x way of taking
    the parameters was just awful - I made it better this time.<br>
    These changes are:
    <ul>
     <li><code>Parse()</code> takes the function as a
         <code>const std::string&amp;</code> (this is fully backwards
	 compatible).
     <li><code>Parse()</code> takes the variables as a
         <code>const std::string&amp;</code> (eg. <code>"xy"</code>). The
         old way of taking variable number of parameters was just a too awful
         hack.
     <li>The <code>Eval()</code> function taking a variable number of
      parameters has been
      removed. Although it was a bit easier to use, it was a hack and led to
      inefficient code (internally the parameters were put inside a dynamically
      allocated array anyways, and that's not the most efficient way of doing
      it; it's much more efficient that the user uses a statically allocated
      local array).
    </ul>
    These changes are not radical, so don't get too alarmed. I'm sure that
    changing old code to this new interface is trivial.
 <li>Added the modulo operator (<code>%</code>) and a new function
     <code>int()</code>.
 <li>I hope that now, at last, all the problems with parsing functions with
    similar beginnings (eg. <code>acos()</code> vs. <code>acosh()</code>) are
    gone. Needs more testing, though...
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>What's new in v1.3:<br>
(Thanks to Roland Schmehl for these bug reports).
<ul>
 <li>The library parsed wrongly sinh, cosh and tanh (confused them with sin,
    cos and tan and then reported a syntax error for the 'h').
 <li>The library parsed an expression like "-cos(x)+cos(y)" like if it
    was "-(cos(x)+cos(y))" instead of "(-cos(x))+cos(y)" as it should. Fixed.
 <li>The library didn't parse correctly numbers in the form "1e-2". Fixed.
 <li>Added some explanations at the end of the fparser.txt file.
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>What's new in v1.21:
<ul>
 <li>Fixed several memory leaks (thanks to Stephen Agate for the bug report).
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>What's new in v1.2:
<ul>
 <li>If you define the identifier NO_ASINH (see the beginning of fparser.cc),
    then support for the functions asinh, acosh and atanh will be removed
    (they are not part of the ANSI C standard and thus not supported by most
    compilers).
 <li>A tiny bug fixed.
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>What's new in v1.1:
<ul>
 <li>Fixed bug that made a negated function (eg. "-sin(x)") crash.
</ul>
