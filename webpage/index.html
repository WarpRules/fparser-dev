<h1>Function Parser for C++ v4.5    </h1>

<h2>What is this library?</h2>

<p>This C++ library offers a class which can be used to parse and evaluate a
mathematical function from a string (which might be eg. requested from the
user). The syntax of the function string is similar to mathematical expressions
written in C/C++ (the exact syntax is specified in the  documentation below).
The function can then be evaluated with different values of variables.

<p>For example, a function like "<code>sin(sqrt(x*x+y*y))</code>" can be
parsed from a string (either <code>std::string</code> or a C-style string)
and then evaluated with different values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
This library can be useful for evaluating user-inputted functions, or in
some cases interpreting mathematical expressions in a scripting language.

<p>This library aims for maximum speed in both parsing and evaluation, while
keeping maximum portability. The library should compile and work with any
standard-conforming C++ compiler.

<p>Different numerical types are supported: <code>double</code>,
  <code>float</code>, <code>long double</code>, <code>long int</code>,
  <code>std::complex</code> (of types <code>double</code>,
  <code>float</code> and <code>long double</code>),
  multiple-precision floating point numbers using the MPFR library, and
  arbitrary precision integers using the GMP library. (Note that it's
  not necessary for these two libraries to exist in the system in order
  to use the Function Parser library with the other numerical types. Support
  for these libraries is optionally compiled in using preprocessor settings.)

<p>This Library is distributed under the
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">Lesser General Public
    License</a> (LGPL) version 3.

<p>Note that the library uses a few advanced (but still standard-conforming)
C++ techniques which might make it difficult if not impossible to compile it
with some old C++ compilers with poorer support for C++ features. The library
has been successfully tested with <em>gcc&nbsp;4.3.x</em> and
<em>MS&nbsp;Visual&nbsp;C++&nbsp;2005</em>. Some very old compilers are known
to have problems compiling the library (such as <em>C++&nbsp;Builder&nbsp;6</em>
and older, and <em>gcc&nbsp;2.x</em>.)

<h2>Development version</h2>

<p>The basic library package above contains the bare minimum files intended
for the usage of the library in C++ applications. If you want to simply use
the library in your program, then download the package above.

<p>The development version of the library is intended for those who want
to modify and enhance the library. Besides the files contained in the
basic package above, the development version contains the full optimizer
sources, optimizer rule generation tools, an extensive automatic regression
testbed, a Makefile and other tools.

<h2>What's new?</h2>

<p>What's new in v4.5
  <ul>
    <li>Removed support for the <code>"eval()"</code> function from the
      supported syntax. (This function was too dangerous, too difficult to
      maintain internally, not very useful, and more or less a gimmick in
      the first place.)
    <li>Removed several of the conditional compiling macro definitions, namely
      <code>FP_SUPPORT_TR1_MATH</code>, <code>FP_ENABLE_EVAL</code>,
      <code>FP_EVAL_MAX_REC_LEVEL</code>, <code>FP_NO_EVALUATION_CHECKS</code>
      and <code>FP_EPSILON</code>.
    <li>The epsilon value used in comparisons is now set with a member function
      of FunctionParser (which allows setting different values for different
      versions of the parser).
    <li>The math functions previously turned on with
      <code>FP_SUPPORT_TR1_MATH</code> are now automatically used if
      <code>__cplusplus</code> indicates that C++11 is in use.
    <li>Fixed some compilation problems with clang++.
