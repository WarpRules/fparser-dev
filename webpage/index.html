<h2>- What's new?</h2>

<p>What's new in v3.0.3
<ul>
 <li>Fixed bug that caused functions like "<code>-if(x, 1, 2)</code>" to be
     parsed incorrectly. (This bug is a very old one, and caused by the change
     related to the unary minus in the version 2.7 of the library.)
 <li>Changed version numbering to a more logical format.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.0.2
<ul>
 <li>Added support for specifying a delimiter character. (See fparser.txt
     for more details.)
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.0.1
<ul>
 <li>Improved UTF8 support, and minor tweaking and fixes.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.0
<ul>
 <li>Rewrote the parser from scratch. It uses the same parsing technique as
    the old parser (iow. it's a recursive descent parser), but because of
    simplification, refactoring and optimizations the new <code>Parse()</code>
    function is over 5 times faster than the old one for most inputs.
 <li>Support for UTF8-encoded unicode characters in user-defined variable,
    constant, unit and function names.
 <li>Unit names are no longer in a distinct namespace from all the other
    names. Thus now unit names must also be distinct from everything else.
 <li>Added the <code>pow()</code> function (which takes two parameters) to the
    function syntax. Its behavior is identical to that of the <code>^</code>
    operator.
</ul>

<p>You can also view the <a href="history.html">full version history</a>.

<hr>

<h2>- Long-term plans</h2>

<p>(Or plans which I would like to implement some day, but may perhaps never
be done.)

<ul>
 <li>Rewrite the optimizer.
 <li>In fact, rewrite the whole thing. The current parser is horrible and rigid
     and hard to maintain (I noticed this when I estimated how hard would it
     be to add support for UTF8-encoded input). The parser really needs a
     true abstract tokenizer.
 <li>Add JIT-compilation support for several platforms (Windows, PC-Linux,
     Sparc-Solaris).
 <li>Change to a different, less troublesome usage license.
</ul>

<h2>- What is this library?</h2>

<p>This is a part of the <code>fparser.txt</code> file
included in the zip file (the file itself contains more info than this;
you can read the entire file <a href="fparser.txt">here</a>).

<p>(You can also look at the simple <a href="example.cc">example program</a>
which comes with the library.)

  - Preface
    -------

  Often people need to ask some mathematical expression from the user and
then evaluate values for that expression. The simplest example is a program
which draws the graphic of a user-defined function on screen.

  This library adds C-style function string parsing to the program. This
means that you can evaluate the string "sqrt(1-x^2+y^2)" with given values
of 'x' and 'y'.

  The library is intended to be very fast. It byte-compiles the function
string at parse time and interpretes this byte-code at evaluation time.
The evaluation is straightforward and no recursions are done (uses stack
arithmetic).
  Empirical tests show that it indeed is very fast (specially compared to
libraries which evaluate functions by just interpreting the raw function
string).

  The library is made in ISO C++ and requires a standard-conforming C++
compiler.


  - The function string
    -------------------

  The function string understood by the class is very similar to the C-syntax.
  Arithmetic float expressions can be created from float literals, variables
or functions using the following operators in this order of precedence:

   ()             expressions in parentheses first
   A unit         a unit multiplier (if one has been added)
   A^B            exponentiation (A raised to the power B)
   -A             unary minus
   !A             unary logical not (result is 1 if int(A) is 0, else 0)
   A*B  A/B  A%B  multiplication, division and modulo
   A+B  A-B       addition and subtraction
   A=B  A!=B  A&lt;B  A&lt;=B  A&gt;B  A&gt;=B
                  comparison between A and B (result is either 0 or 1)
   A&amp;B            result is 1 if int(A) and int(B) differ from 0, else 0.
   A|B            result is 1 if int(A) or int(B) differ from 0, else 0.

    Since the unary minus has higher precedence than any other operator, for
  example the following expression is valid: x*-y

    The comparison operators use an epsilon value, so expressions which may
  differ in very least-significant digits should work correctly. For example,
  "0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1+0.1 = 1" should always return 1, and
  the same comparison done with "&gt;" or "&lt;" should always return 0.
  (The epsilon value can be configured in the fpconfig.hh file.)
  Without epsilon this comparison probably returns the wrong value.

  The class supports these functions:

  abs(A)    : Absolute value of A. If A is negative, returns -A otherwise
              returns A.
  acos(A)   : Arc-cosine of A. Returns the angle, measured in radians,
              whose cosine is A.
  acosh(A)  : Same as acos() but for hyperbolic cosine.
  asin(A)   : Arc-sine of A. Returns the angle, measured in radians, whose
              sine is A.
  asinh(A)  : Same as asin() but for hyperbolic sine.
  atan(A)   : Arc-tangent of (A). Returns the angle, measured in radians,
              whose tangent is (A).
  atan2(A,B): Arc-tangent of A/B. The two main differences to atan() is
              that it will return the right angle depending on the signs of
              A and B (atan() can only return values betwen -pi/2 and pi/2),
              and that the return value of pi/2 and -pi/2 are possible.
  atanh(A)  : Same as atan() but for hyperbolic tangent.
  ceil(A)   : Ceiling of A. Returns the smallest integer greater than A.
              Rounds up to the next higher integer.
  cos(A)    : Cosine of A. Returns the cosine of the angle A, where A is
              measured in radians.
  cosh(A)   : Same as cos() but for hyperbolic cosine.
  cot(A)    : Cotangent of A (equivalent to 1/tan(A)).
  csc(A)    : Cosecant of A (equivalent to 1/sin(A)).
  eval(...) : This a recursive call to the function to be evaluated. The
              number of parameters must be the same as the number of parameters
              taken by the function. Usually called inside if() to avoid
              infinite recursion.
  exp(A)    : Exponential of A. Returns the value of e raised to the power
              A where e is the base of the natural logarithm, i.e. the
              non-repeating value approximately equal to 2.71828182846.
  floor(A)  : Floor of A. Returns the largest integer less than A. Rounds
              down to the next lower integer.
  if(A,B,C) : If int(A) differs from 0, the return value of this function is B,
              else C. Only the parameter which needs to be evaluated is
              evaluated, the other parameter is skipped; this makes it safe to
              use eval() in them.
  int(A)    : Rounds A to the closest integer. 0.5 is rounded to 1.
  log(A)    : Natural (base e) logarithm of A.
  log10(A)  : Base 10 logarithm of A.
  max(A,B)  : If A&gt;B, the result is A, else B.
  min(A,B)  : If A&lt;B, the result is A, else B.
  pow(A,B)  : Exponentiation (A raised to the power B).
  sec(A)    : Secant of A (equivalent to 1/cos(A)).
  sin(A)    : Sine of A. Returns the sine of the angle A, where A is
              measured in radians.
  sinh(A)   : Same as sin() but for hyperbolic sine.
  sqrt(A)   : Square root of A. Returns the value whose square is A.
  tan(A)    : Tangent of A. Returns the tangent of the angle A, where A
              is measured in radians.
  tanh(A)   : Same as tan() but for hyperbolic tangent.


  Examples of function string understood by the class:

  "1+2"
  "x-1"
  "-sin(sqrt(x^2+y^2))"
  "sqrt(XCoord*XCoord + YCoord*YCoord)"

  An example of a recursive function is the factorial function:

  "if(n&gt;1, n*eval(n-1), 1)"

  Note that a recursive call has some overhead, which makes it a bit slower
  than any other operation. It may be a good idea to avoid recursive functions
  in very time-critical applications. Recursion also takes some memory, so
  extremely deep recursions should be avoided (eg. millions of nested recursive
  calls).

  Also note that even though the maximum recursion level of eval() is
  limited, it is possible to write functions which never reach that level
  but still take enormous amounts of time to evaluate.
  This can sometimes be undesirable because it is prone to exploitation,
  but you can disable the eval() function completely in the fpconfig.hh file.

  Usage license:
  -------------

Copyright © 2003 Juha Nieminen, Joel Yliluoma

  This library is distributed under two distinct usage licenses depending
on the software ("Software" below) which uses the Function Parser library
("Library" below).
  The reason for having two distinct usage licenses is to make the library
compatible with the GPL license while still being usable in other non-GPL
(even commercial) software.

A) If the Software using the Library is distributed under the GPL license,
   then the Library can be used under the GPL license as well.

   The Library will be under the GPL license only when used with the
   Software. If the Library is separated from the Software and used in
   another different software under a different license, then the Library
   will have the B) license below.

   Exception to the above: If the Library is modified for the GPL Software,
   then the Library cannot be used with the B) license without the express
   permission of the author of the modifications. A modified library will
   be under the GPL license by default. That is, only the original,
   unmodified version of the Library can be taken to another software
   with the B) license below.

   The author of the Software should provide an URL to the original
   version of the Library if the one used in the Software has been
   modified. (http://iki.fi/warp/FunctionParser/)

   This text file must be distributed in its original intact form along
   with the sources of the Library. (Documentation about possible
   modifications to the library should be put in a different text file.)

B) If the Software using the Library is not distributed under the GPL
   license but under any other license, then the following usage license
   applies to the Library:

  1. This library is free for non-commercial usage. You can do whatever you
     like with it as long as you don't claim you made it yourself.

  2. It is possible to use this library in a commercial program, but in this
     case you MUST contact me first (warp@iki.fi) and ask express permission
     for this. (Read explanation at the end of the file.)
       If you are making a free program or a shareware program with just a
     nominal price (5 US dollars or less), you don't have to ask for
     permission.
       In any case, I DON'T WANT MONEY for the usage of this library. It is
     free, period.

  3. You can make any modifications you want to it so that it conforms your
     needs. If you make modifications to it, you have, of course, credits for
     the modified parts.

  4. If you use this library in your own program, you don't have to provide
     the source code if you don't want to (ie. the source code of your program
     or this library).
       If you DO include the source code for this library, this text file
     must be included in its original intact form.

  5. If you distribute a program which uses this library, and specially if you
     provide the source code, proper credits MUST be included. Trying to
     obfuscate the fact that this library is not made by you or that it is
     free is expressly prohibited. When crediting the usage of this library,
     it's enough to include my name and email address, that is:
     "Juha Nieminen (warp@iki.fi)". Also a URL to the library download page
     would be nice, although not required. The official URL is:
       http://iki.fi/warp/FunctionParser/

  6. And the necessary "lawyer stuff":

     The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
     included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

     The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind,
     express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.
     In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any
     claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
     tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the
     software or the use or other dealings in the software.


---  Explanation of the section 2 of the B) license above:

  The section 2 tries to define "fair use" of the library in commercial
programs.
  "Fair use" of the library means that the program is not heavily dependent
on the library, but the library only provides a minor secondary feature
to the program.
  "Heavily dependent" means that the program depends so much on the library
that without it the functionality of the program would be seriously
degraded or the program would even become completely non-functional.

  In other words: If the program does not depend heavily on the library,
that is, the library only provides a minor secondary feature which could
be removed without the program being degraded in any considerable way,
then it's OK to use the library in the commercial program.
  If, however, the program depends so heavily on the library that
removing it would make the program non-functional or degrade its
functionality considerably, then it's NOT OK to use the library.

  The ideology behind this is that it's not fair to use a free library
as a base for a commercial program, but it's fair if the library is
just a minor, unimportant extra.

  If you are going to ask me for permission to use the library in a
commercial program, please describe the feature which the library will
be providing and how important it is to the program.
