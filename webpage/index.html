<h2>Development version</h2>

<p>The basic library package above contains the bare minimum files intended
for the usage of the library in C++ applications. If you want to simply use
the library in your program, then download the package above.

<p>The development version of the library is intended for those who want
to modify and enhance the library. Besides the files contained in the
basic package above, the development version contains the full optimizer
sources, optimizer rule generation tools, an extensive automatic regression
testbed, a Makefile and other tools.

<p>Download the development package:
<a href="fparser3.1.2_devel.tar.bz2">fparser3.1.2_devel.tar.bz2</a>

<h2>What's new?</h2>

<p>What's new in v3.1.2
<ul>
 <li>Fixed the bugs in the new optimizer code, and thus the new optimizer
     has been restored.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.1.1
<ul>
 <li>Due to several bugs in the new optimizer, the old optimizer (from the
    library version 3.0.3) has been temporarily restored until these bugs
    are fixed. The other new library features are not affected.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.1
<ul>
 <li>The optimizer has been completely rewritten. The new optimizer contains
     more and better optimization rules than before, and is more easily
     extensible.
 <li>The <code>Parse()</code> function now precalculates simple constant
     expressions which can be calculated without compromising parsing speed.
     For example the input function "<code>x+7/2</code>" will be byte-compiled
     into the equivalent of "<code>x+3.5</code>". (Note that precalculation of
     constant expressions at parse time is limited and doesn't work in all
     possible situations. For example a function like "<code>x+1+2</code>"
     cannot be precalculated into "<code>x+3</code>" because of the way
     single-token lookahead recursive descent parsing works. The
     <code>Optimize()</code> function will do a much more comprehensive
     optimization work.)
 <li>A new development version of the library is available. The development
     version of the library contains the full optimizer sources, an extensive
     regression testbed, a Makefile and other tools.
 <li>Fixed bug: The size of the internal stack was incorrectly calculated
     in certain situations where a user-defined function taking 0 parameters
     was used. In some rare circumstances this could potentially cause an
     out-of-boundaries array access.
 <li>A new HTML version of the documentation is available. Also a small
     clarification about authorship and crediting was made to the usage
     license.
</ul>
