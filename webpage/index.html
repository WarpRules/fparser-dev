<h2>Development version</h2>

<p>The basic library package above contains the bare minimum files intended
for the usage of the library in C++ applications. If you want to simply use
the library in your program, then download the package above.

<p>The development version of the library is intended for those who want
to modify and enhance the library. Besides the files contained in the
basic package above, the development version contains the full optimizer
sources, optimizer rule generation tools, an extensive automatic regression
testbed, a Makefile and other tools.

<h2>What's new?</h2>

<p>What's new in v3.3.2
<ul>
 <li>Fixed an incompatibility with MS Visual Studio which caused the optimizer
   to enter an infinite loop with some input functions (VS interprets bitfields
   slightly differently from gcc). Also minor additions and fine-tuning of the
   optimizer.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.3.1
<ul>
 <li>Fixed some incompatibilities with MS Visual Studio introduced with the
   refactored optimizer.
</ul>

<p>What's new in v3.3
<ul>
 <li>The <code>Parse()</code> method now performs more exhaustive constant
   folding (calculating constant expressions at parse time) than before.
   Also integral powers (eg. like <code>"x^4"</code>) are now more optimized
   at parse time, resulting in faster evaluation even without a call to the
   <code>Optimize()</code> method (although the latter will sometimes still
   result in an even better result). The speed impact of this on the
   <code>Parse()</code> method has been kept minimal.
 <li>More refactoring of the optimizer, making the <code>Optimize()</code>
   method significantly faster than in the previous version. Also new and
   more exhaustive rules have been added, resulting in better results in
   certain cases (eg. when using basic operators in very complex functions).
 <li>Added utility member functions to parse a function so that the variables
   in the function are deduced automatically. The found variables are returned
   to the caller if requested.
</ul>
