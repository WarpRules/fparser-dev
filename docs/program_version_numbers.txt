The version numbers reported by the utility programs is set at the beginning
of their source code. This version number is maintained manually and should
be update every time the source code is modified in any way. The version
number is of the form:

    A.B.C.D

  The meaning of the four values are:

A: The main version number, 0 for an alpha version which is not yet
   completely functional, 1 or larger for a working program.

   This number should be incremented only if a major rewrite or
   refactoring is done which changes the entire structure of the
   program very significantly. Thus this will often be 1 forever.

   Incrementing this number zeroes B and C (but not D).

B: Major subversion number, starting from 0 forwards. Should be incremented
   if a significant addition or modification is done to the program (such
   as adding new significant command-line options, or support for a new
   parser type).

   Incrementing this number zeroes C (but not D).

C: Minor subversion number, starting from 0 forwards. Should be incremented
   if a minor (but non-cosmetic) addition or modification is done to the
   program. Purely cosmetic changes (such as changing indentation or the
   wording of a printed sentence, or adding a few comments) does not warrant
   increasing this number.

D: Modification counter. This should be incremented every time a new
   modified version of the source code is committed into the project
   (and regardless of whether A, B or C were modified), no matter how
   insignificant (even if it's just indentation). This number never
   decreases.
