/* NOTE:
   This is a concatenation of all the header and source files of the
   original optimizer source code. All the code has been concatenated
   into this single file for convenience of usage (in other words, to
   simply use the optimizer, it's enough to add this file to the project
   rather than a multitude of files which the original optimizer source
   code is composed of).

   Thus this file exists for the usage of the Function parser library
   only, and is not suitable for developing it further. If you want to
   develop the library further, you should download the development
   version of the library, which has all the original source files.
